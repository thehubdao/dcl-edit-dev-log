# 004 Launch

Hey dcl-edit community,

Sorry for the radio silence on our dev-logs lately! We've been heads down working on launching dcl-edit and it's been a wild ride. But don't worry, we're here to give you the lowdown on what's been happening since our last update.

We've made some serious progress on improving the dcl-edit experience for you all. Our team has been working tirelessly to bring you some exciting new features and improvements, and we can't wait to share them with you.

Thanks for your patience and support as we continue to make dcl-edit the best scene editor for Decentraland. Let's get into it!

## Asset property
One of the new features we've been working on is the addition of asset properties to dcl-edit. Previously, a property could only be a simple text or number, but now it can also be an asset such as a 3D model or another scene. With this new feature, changing an asset property is as easy as clicking on the asset button next to it. This will open up the asset browser, where the user can select a new asset to replace the current one. The asset browser is intuitive and easy to use, making it simple to find the perfect asset for your scene.
